# Password-Generator

The purpose of this project was to develop a random password generator using javascript.

## User Story
    AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
    I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
    SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN I need a new, secure password
    WHEN I click the button to generate a password
    THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
    WHEN prompted for password criteria
    THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
    WHEN prompted for the length of the password
    THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
    WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
    THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
    WHEN I answer each prompt
    THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
    WHEN all prompts are answered
    THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
    WHEN the password is generated
    THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
